# Minimal-Node-Ts-Server-Starter

A tiny, minimal starter for a Node + Express app written in TypeScript and intended to run with Bun.

This repository is a lightweight starting point â€” perfect for forking, experimenting, or using as the basis for small services (including Firebase-backed apps). The project was bootstrapped with Bun and runs TypeScript directly with Bun's runtime.

## Quick start

Prerequisites:

- Bun installed (https://bun.sh)
- Git (to fork/clone)

1) Fork this repository on GitHub.

2) Clone your fork and change into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/node-firebase.git
cd node-firebase
```

3) Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
