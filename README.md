# Minimal-Node-Ts-Server-Starter

A tiny, minimal starter for a Node + Express app written in TypeScript and intended to run with Bun.

This repository is a lightweight starting point â€” perfect for forking, experimenting .The project was bootstrapped with Bun and runs TypeScript directly with Bun's runtime. Also it's initialized with Biome.js linting which is a new and very powerful tool which replaces the linting of Eslint and prettier
